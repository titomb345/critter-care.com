# About Critter Care

## Our Story

Critter Care was founded in November 1999 by Laurie, who transitioned from the entertainment industry where she worked as an administrative assistant. Growing up surrounded by animals — including German Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels, cats, birds, and various other creatures — shaped a deep, lifelong passion for pet care.

What started as a love for animals has grown into over 25 years of dedicated, professional pet sitting service in the South Bay area of Los Angeles.
